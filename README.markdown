# canvas-liquify

This is an HTML5 canvas implementation of the "Liquify" (Adobe Photoshop) or "IWarp" (GIMP) effect as a brush using the mouse or by dragging.

Inspired by Zlatan Bratovic's [LiquifyFilter Class](http://board.flashkit.com/board/showthread.php?644249-Links-to-Flash8-examples&s=f790bd2bc5c5152decb9cccbc136a23c&p=3644092&viewfull=1#post3644092) in Flash.
